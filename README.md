## Workshopping:

### Questions

_Do manipulated communities deviate more strongly from statistical theories than control communities?_

Variations on this could include:

- communities that have recently undergone a disturbance
- communities passing along a chronosequence/successional trajectory
- communities subject to greater human modification/pressure
- heavily invaded communities
- communities exhibiting greater change at lower levels of organization (e.g. species, compositional turnover)

### Data

Possible beginning data sources (immediately available):

- Supp's manipulated animal community database
- Portal plants
- Portal rodents

Next-level data sources (some getting-together required):

- BBS (or FIA?) overlaid with land-use change, fire history
- BBS x LDATs of some description
- Compilation of experimental manipulations data - perhaps with some level of constraint/directed scope, e.g. burn experiments, successional studies. Surely someone has done a meta-analysis of how SADs from early/late succession, etc vary in shape? Perhaps some of the data from the canonical SAD or succession lit is open-access. 
- Meso/microcosm experiments
- Forestry data
- Invaded islands
- 

Kind of frustrating, in that I think it's actually stronger/more interesting to look at something for which we feel good about arguing for a transition from perturbed --> "stable state", than something more observational. Otherwise how do we know that the "control" community is really the one we expect to be at equilibrium? Limits what we can learn from this. But I still think there's something there.

### Methods

#### "Equilibrial" baseline

I think METE and/or the feasible set are reasonable starting points. 

#### "Deviates more strongly"

Curious what AJR thinks about this; happySAD

%off metric works - hackily? - for manually sampled baselines.

### Interpretations

Depends a bit on data sources.

\delta S and N is important. Statistical power is important.

The "equilibrium"ness of the control is important.

### Sidebars

- Naturally dovetails with an in silico perturbations simulations project
- I get persistently hung up on the question of whether e.g. neutral theory would converge with METE or the feasible set. Or whyyyyy the hollow curve emerges.
